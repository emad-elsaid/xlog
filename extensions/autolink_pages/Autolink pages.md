#extension

Autolink pages extension converts any text that matches another page title to a link automatically.
For example just by writing (xlog), it links to another page called `xlog.md`.
So as a writer you don't have to go back retroactively and add links to your page in older pages.
Also it keeps backlinks to the current page and show a list of them under the page for quick access to relevant pages.
