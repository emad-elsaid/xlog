A way for taking notes or writing down knowledge. it depends on rough and incomplete posts/notes instead of complete full blog posts. 

You end up with personal wiki. non-hierarchical and not complete. but it represent the scattered and linked knowledge of a person.

This is Xlog digital garden. a set of markdown files that contains the knowledge related to xlog. and built with it into static website. everytime a page name is mentioned in text xlog converts it to a link. so you get to navigate the text and expand on abbreviations or concepts as you go.
