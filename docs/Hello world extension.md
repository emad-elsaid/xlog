By the end of this tutorial you'll learn:

* Creating a new extension
* Creating a custom installation that loads the core and your extension
* Using xlog public API to manipulate the page before processing

# What are we creating

We will create a new Xlog extension that adds "Hello World!" before the page text.

# Creating an extension

Xlog extensions are Go modules (check extensions for more details). So make sure Go toolchain is installed on your system.

First create an empty directory and initialize a new go module in it

```shell
mkdir helloworld
cd helloworld
go mod init github.com/emad-elsaid/helloworld
go get github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog
```

Replace the URL to your github account or any other URL where your extension will be hosted. as per Go modules convention.

# Create a custom installation

To test our extension we need a `main` package that loads xlog and your own extension.

We'll create `cmd/xlog/xlog.go` that acts as custom installation.

```shell
mkdir -p cmd/xlog
```

Create a file under `cmd/xlog/xlog.go` that has the following content.

```go
package main

import (
	// Core
	"github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog"

	// Extensions
	_ "github.com/emad-elsaid/helloworld"
)

func main() {
	xlog.Start()
}
```

# Create an extension

Lets make sure Go finds a `helloworld` package in your module root. it'll do nothing for now.

Create a file `helloworld.go` that contains the package name.

```go
package helloworld
```

# Run your custom installation

Now running `cmd/xlog/xlog.go` will start the xlog core with only your extension loaded. so it's a clean environment that include only the xlog core and no other extensions.

```shell
go run ./cmd/xlog/xlog.go
```

You should see output similar to the following. And navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) should drop you in the editor to create your `index.md` page.

```

/info From now on any change to any of the Go files will require restarting the xlog server


# Create your first test page

* Try opening  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Enter any text. for example: "We are creating a Hello world Xlog extension."
* Click "Save" or "Ctrl+S"
* You should see your page rendered in HTML

# Define a Preprocessor

Packages add features to Xlog by calling `Register*` functions in the `init` function of the page. This allow registering a group of types for xlog to use in the appropriate time. Like:

* Preprocessor
* Autocomplete
* Command

For our extension we want to add "Hello world!" before the actual page content. this is exactly what the Preprocessor is for. a function that processes the page text before rendering it to HTML.

We will create a function that implement the [Preprocessor interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog#Preprocessor). `helloworld.go` should have the following content.

```go
package helloworld

func addHelloWorld(input xlog.Markdown) xlog.Markdown {
	return "Hello world!\n" + input
}
```

This is a function that takes the page content as string and return the content after processing. You can manipulate the page content as you wish in this function. for us we added a line in the beginning of the page.

# The Init function

Now we'll need to register this function as a preprocessor. we'll do this by importing xlog core and use [`RegisterPreprocessor`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog#RegisterPreprocessor).

```go
package helloworld

import "github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog"

func init() {
	xlog.RegisterPreprocessor(addHelloWorld)
}

func addHelloWorld(input xlog.Markdown) xlog.Markdown {
	return "Hello world!\n" + input
}
```

Restarting the server and refreshing your web page will show the following:

```
Hello world!
We are creating a Hello world Xlog extension.
```

# Success

Congrates, You created a new xlog extension. Now you can publish this extension to github and import it in any custom installation of xlog.

Also you may try to explore Xlog package documentation to get familiar with other types and `Register` functions.
