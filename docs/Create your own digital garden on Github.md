3. Go to **Pages** from the sidebar under **Code and automation**
4. Under **Build and deployment** > **Source** choose **Github Actions**

# Create A Home page

1. Go to your repository **Code** page (first tab at the top of the repository)
2. Click **Add file** > **Create new file**
3. Name your file: **index.md**
4. Add any content to your file. for example: **Hello world!**
5. Click **Commit new file**

# Add Github workflow

          path: .

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1
```
5. if your main branch name is different than `master` please change it in the previous file.
6. Make sure you replace any occurrence of **user-name** with your user name.
7. Click **Commit new file**
8. Go to **Actions** tab. you should find a run in progress. After it completes move to the next step.

# Visiting your digital garden

* Now your digital garden should be available under **user-name.github.io**
* Visit the previous URL to make sure everything works
* If the page doesn't appear with **Hello world!** content (or the content you wrote) then something is wrong with the previous steps.

# Writing new pages

1. When you want to add a new page to your garden add the file in your repository and make sure it's in **.md** (Markdown) format.
2. After Github finishes building the page should be served as HTML with the same name without **.md** extension
3. For example **about.md** will be served as **/about**
4. keep your files names meaningful. as Xlog will autolink pages together by the file name.
5. so in any page when you have the word **about** in the text, Xlog will convert it to a link to the **about** page.
